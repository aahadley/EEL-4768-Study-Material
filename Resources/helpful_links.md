## [But how Do it Know?: The Basic Principles of Computers for Everyone](http://www.buthowdoitknow.com/services.html)
Excellent book that explains computer architecture concepts in an understandable way. $7.39 on Google Play at the time I'm writing this. The next few resources are based on this book.

## [Interactive CPU Model](http://www.buthowdoitknow.com/cpu_model_intro.html)
I'd recommend exploring the rest of this website for additional resources.

## [How A CPU Works - In One Lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNN_tTXABUA&t=2m20sec)
YouTube video presenting a crash course in computer architecture.

## [Additional Slides](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse378/09wi/lectures.html)
These came from a class at University of Washington. It follows an earlier edition of our textbook, but the material is all the same.
