A script for running the project 1 experiments.

To run this script, put in in the same folder as your source code, and the two trace files.  
The source code **must** be named sim.c , and the trace files **must** be named XSBENCH.t and MINIFE.t  
Finally, from the command line, type:

    bash exp.c > out.txt

The name of the output file is your choice, and you don't need to create it beforehand.

For best results, make sure your program returns 1 on failure.
