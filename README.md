# Topics:

##  ISA:

> True / false or multiple choice about: ISA definition, classification/ comparison, alignments, big vs little endian, instruction format, fields,

###     ISA Definition:
###     ISA Classification/Comparison:
###     Alignments:
###     Big Endian vs Little Endian:
###     Instruction Format:
###     Fields:

##  Architectures: (translating expressions to assembly)

> translate certain expression that includes variables and operations into assembly of one of
architecture, i.e. load-store, or register-memory, stack etc., instructions will be provided in random order.

###     Load-Store:
###     Register-Memory:
###     Stack:
###     ...

##  MIPS 64:

> translate C-like code into MIPS64 , C code can be if - else statement , or for loop, addresses of variables
will be included, in addition to the list of MIPS64 instructions.

###     Translate c-like code into MIPS64:
####        if-else:
####        while loop:
####        for loop:

##  Single Cycle Datapath:

> Single Cycle datapath: features, restrictions, components, control signals for each instructions/ format
(original datapath)

###     Features:
###     Restrictions:
###     Components:
###     Control Signals: (and format)

##  Modifying the datapath:

> how to modify for certain instructions, just likes examples discussed in the class and in the HW3, or
highlight parts of datapath

###     (on paper)
