##  ISA:

> True / false or multiple choice about: ISA definition, classification/ comparison, alignments, big vs little endian, instruction format, fields,

###     ISA Definition:

#### An ISA consists of:
* List of all instructions 
* The format of the instructions
* The addressing modes.

###     ISA Classification/Comparison:

####        Accumulator:

</p> Accumulator architectures were common in early CPUs when it was not possible to have a lot of registers. The accumulator is used in all operations. It is not used anymore due to its rigidity and long assembly code. </p>

##### Pros:
* Simple compiler
* Simple hardware
##### Cons:
* Rigid
* Restrictive in parallelism
* Long assembly codes

####        Stack:

</p> Used up to 1980s. The two ALU operands are popped from the stack, and the result is pushed. 
Data from memory can be pushed to the stack and data on the stack can be popped into memory. </p>

##### Pros:
* Simple compiler
* Simple hardware
##### Cons:
* Restrictive in parallelism
* Long assembly codes


![st](https://puu.sh/BEJ3M/fed3ce44b7.png)

---

####        Memory-Memory:

</p> No registers are used. All data is kept in the computer's main memory. slow as hecc </p>

##### Pros:
* Variables don't have to be allocated. Easy memory management
##### Cons:
* Every operation requires multiple memory accesses. (ew)
* Slow

---

####        Register-Memory:

</p> Operates directly on data within the memory. The ALU can take one input from the registers, and one from memory, or it can take both operations from the registers. </p>

##### Pros:
* Data in memory can be accessed directly.
* Simple compiler
* Short code
##### Cons:
* Non-uniform instructions
* Some instructions require many clock cycles.
* Complex encoding

---

####        Load-Store:

</p> Sometimes called register-register achitecture, the ALU takes both inputs from the registers.As a result, it can't access memory directly. </p>

##### Pros:
* Simple encoding
* Few bits required to specify registers.
* Uniform procesing.
##### Cons:
* Long Code
* Every variable requires load and store instructions.

###     Big Endian vs Little Endian:

####        Big Endian:
            Data type ends at the big address.

            0x012EAC34                    "ABCD"
            +----+----+----+----+       +---+---+---+---+
            | 01 | 2E | AC | 34 |       | A | B | C | D |
            +----+----+----+----+       +---+---+---+---+

####        Little Endian:
            Data type ends at the little address.

            0x012EAC34                  "ABCD"
            +----+----+----+----+       +---+---+---+---+
            | 34 | AC | 2E | 01 |       | D | C | B | A |
            +----+----+----+----+       +---+---+---+---+

---

###     Alignments:

* Objects larger than 1 byte must be aligned.
* An access to an object s at address A is aligned if A mod s = 0.
* Misalignment is a problem because accessing a misaligned object may require access to multiple aligned addresses.

##  Architectures: (translating expressions to assembly)

> translate certain expression that includes variables and operations into assembly of one of
architecture, i.e. load-store, or register-memory, stack etc., instructions will be provided in random order.

High level code to translate:

```C
f = (a + b) * c / (e - d);
```

###     Load-Store:
```
LOAD    a
ADD     b   # a + b
STORE   a   # A <-- (a + b)
LOAD    e
SUB     d   # e - d
STORE   e   # e <-- (e - d)
LOAD    a
MUL     c   # (a + b) * c
DIV     e   # (a + b) * c / (e - d)
STORE   a   # a <-- (a + b) * c / (e - d) should this be f?
```

---

###     Stack:
```
PUSH e      # ]e
PUSH d      # ]e, d
SUB         # ](e-d)
PUSH a      # ](e-d), a
PUSH b      # ](e-d), a, b
ADD         # ](e-d), (a+b)
PUSH c      # ](e-d), (a+b), c
MUL         # ](e-d), (a+b)*c
DIV         # ](a+b)*c / (e-d)
POP         # ].
```

---

###     Register-Memory:
```
LOAD    R1, a   
ADD     R1, b       # R1 <-- a + b
LOAD    R2, e   
SUB     R2, d       # R2 <-- e - d
MUL     R1, c       # R1 <-- (a + b) * c
DIV     R1, R2      # R1 <-- (a + b) * c / (e - d)
STORE   a, R2       # a <-- R2
```

---

###     Load-Store
```
LOAD    R1, a       # R1  <-- a
LOAD    R2, b       # R2  <-- b
ADD     R1, R2      # R1 <-- a + b
LOAD    R3, e       # R3 <-- e
LOAD    R4, d       # R4 <-- d
SUB     R3, R4      # R3 <-- e - d
LOAD    R5, c       # R5 <-- c
MUL     R1, R5      # R1 <-- (a + b) * c
DIV     R1, R3      # R1 <-- (a + b) * c - (e - d)
STORE   a, R1       # a  <-- R1
```

##  MIPS 64:

> translate C-like code into MIPS64 , C code can be if - else statement , or for loop, addresses of variables
will be included, in addition to the list of MIPS64 instructions.

###     Translate c-like code into MIPS64:
####        Comparing Floats

```C
|a2 â€“ b| < epsilon
```

```assembly
.data
a:      .float 0.1

.text
# load the addresses of variables into registers
LA      R1, a
LA      R2, b
LA      R3, e

# load into FPRs (single precision)
L.S     F0, 0(R1)
L.S     F1, 0(R2)
L.S     F2, 0(R3)

MUL.s   F0, F0, F0
SUB.S   F3, F0, F1
ABS.S   F3, F3
C.LT.S  F3, F2

```

    Convert a floating point value to an integer,
    Add it to an integer register

```assembly

####        Working with Double Words
```C

##  Single Cycle Datapath:

> Single Cycle datapath: features, restrictions, components, control signals for each instructions/ format
(original datapath)

![dp](https://puu.sh/BERqv/5b58a49b12.png)

###     Features:

* simple implementation
* each instruction takes one clock cycle

###     Restrictions:

* No parallelism
* slooow

###     Components:

#### Fetch

#####   Consists of:

* Program Counter
* Instruction Memory
* Adder

![fetch](https://puu.sh/BESf9/4412b4ecd0.png)

---

#### Execute

##### Consists of:

* Register File
* ALU
* Data Memory

![ex](https://puu.sh/BESlH/52a49906e3.png)

---

#### Decode

Because some components can take multiple different inputs, we need to add multiplexers so those components can choose their input.
Each multiplexer is connected to a control signal.

![control](https://puu.sh/BESsc/b7f6464e86.png)

---

#### Sign Extender and Shifter
The ALU requires 32-bit inputs, but the immediate field is only 16 bits, so we sign-extend 16 bits. 
Likewise,we need to calculate 32-but offsets for load, store, and branch instructions.
A shifter is added to easily multiply the address offset by 4.
